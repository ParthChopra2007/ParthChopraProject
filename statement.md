Problem Statement

Hostel residents rely on safe and high-quality drinking water, but there is no simple system available to monitor and compare the water quality of different hostel blocks. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is a key indicator of water purity, yet hostel authorities often lack a structured method to record, update, or visualize these values. This creates difficulty in identifying blocks with unsafe water and prevents timely corrective action. The project aims to solve this issue by providing a Python-based system that can record TDS values, classify water quality, update or remove entries, and display real-time graphical visualization to support effective monitoring.

Scope of the Project

The project covers the recording of TDS values for hostel blocks, classification based on water quality standards, modification or removal of existing data, and real-time visualization through a dynamic graph. It operates entirely on a menu-driven console interface. The scope is limited to local execution without database storage, networking, IoT integration, or automated sensor inputs. The main focus is on providing an easy-to-use system for monitoring and understanding TDS levels and their implications for water quality.

Target Users

The system is designed for hostel wardens, college hostel administrators, and maintenance staff responsible for ensuring the quality of drinking water. It can also be used by students and beginners learning Python programming and data visualization, as the project demonstrates practical use of conditional logic, list operations, and real-time graph plotting.

High-Level Features

The system allows users to enter TDS values for multiple hostel blocks and immediately receive a classification of water quality. Stored values can be updated or removed as needed, and users can view all records on demand. The application also provides a live bar graph that refreshes automatically, showing TDS values and their respective quality categories with appropriate color coding. This combination of data entry, modification, classification, and real-time visualization forms the core functionality of the project and provides a complete solution for monitoring hostel water quality
